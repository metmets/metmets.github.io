		<h3>First meeting</h3> <p> 04.12.2015 </p>
		<p> _______________ </p>
		<p> So on that friday was my first club meeting. Most likely the hardest thing was that they were 4th graders and the workshops that we used were too complicated for them. Also there was the language barrier. But the coolest thing is that I was told that the children went home and talked how cool and exiting that club meeting was. </p>

		<h3> Second meeting</h3> <p> 11.12.2015 </p>
		<p> The meeting was cancelled due to the children being at a field trip </p>
